# Mini Project on VLAB-for-Digital-Logic-and-Computer-Architecture
# The VLab contains 2 experiments:
# 1. To realize the Gates using Universal Gates
# 2. Ripple Carry Adder
# Every experiment contains 1 theory page, 1 procedure(for Simulation) page, simulaton page and a quiz page.
# All inputs to be given in the simulation are to be Binary inputs.
# For ripple-carry adder, both inputs must be 4-bit binary numbers.
